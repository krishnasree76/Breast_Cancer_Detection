# **AI Breast Cancer Diagnostic Assistant**

An AI-powered tool leveraging machine learning to classify breast tumors as malignant or benign, providing early and accurate detection. This project uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset and features a Streamlit-based interactive web interface for real-time insights and predictions.

## **Overview**

Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. This project utilizes the **AdaBoost algorithm** with **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)** to address class imbalance and deliver accurate classifications. The platform offers a blend of predictive analytics, feature visualizations, and performance metrics, ensuring a comprehensive diagnostic experience.

## **Key Features**
